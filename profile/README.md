**Welcome to the VIT Bhopal AI Innovators Hub! We are a group of students and professionals passionate about using AI and data science to create positive social impact.**


## About VIT Bhopal AI Innovators Hub
The VIT Bhopal AI Innovators Hub is a community chapter based at the VIT Bhopal University. Our goal is to create a community of students and professionals who are interested in AI and data science for social impact. We organize workshops, hackathons, and projects to explore AI's potential to solve real-world problems.


## **Current Project**

### Monitoring Water Quality in Bhopal Region Using Satellite Imagery and GIS Techniques
- **Objective:** Monitor water quality in Bhopal region using satellite imagery to reduce cost and improve monitoring process.

- **Approach:** Conduct data analysis on satellite imagery to extract relevant parameters and identify patterns. Develop a visualization dashboard to present data in a user-friendly manner.

- **Goal:** Establish a standardized way of collecting real-time data, identify discrepancies, and improve monitoring process for informed decision-making.


## **Next Project**

### AI-Based Road Inspection System for India
- **Project:** Develop a machine learning-based road inspection system using computer vision techniques to detect road abnormalities, defects, and damages in India.

- **Objective:** Improve road safety and infrastructure in India by automating road inspection, identifying causes for pitfalls, sinks, flooding, and traffic congestion.

- **Approach:** Use machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze road conditions and identify areas in need of repair.
